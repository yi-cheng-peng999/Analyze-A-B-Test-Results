# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Introduction
For this project, I worked on an e-commerce website data to understand the results of an A/B test. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
